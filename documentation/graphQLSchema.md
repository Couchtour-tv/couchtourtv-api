First, configure your aws profile:
In the command line type "aws configure"
```bash
aws configure
```
       Configure  AWS  CLI  options. If this command is run with no arguments,
       you will be prompted for configuration values such as your  AWS  Access
       Key  Id and your AWS Secret Access Key.  You can configure a named pro-
       file using the --profile argument.  If your config file does not  exist
       (the default location is ~/.aws/config), the AWS CLI will create it for
       you.  To keep an existing value, hit enter when prompted for the value.
       When  you  are prompted for information, the current value will be dis-
       played in [brackets].  If the config item has no value, it be displayed
       as [None].  Note that the configure command only works with values from
       the config file.  It does not use any configuration values  from  envi-
       ronment variables or the IAM role.


Second, run 'npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli' to install the amplify cli
```bash
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli  
```

WORKFLOW: 
  We work on the schema (amplify/backend/api/couchtourtvamplify/schema.graphql) from couchtourtv-api using the 'amplify mock' amplify CLI command.
  Once schema queries and mutations work the way we want them to, we run 'amplify push' in command line to push schema to cloud so we can pull the 
  resources from the cloud into our frontend react project.

GraphQL defines the following default scalars:

ID
A unique identifier for an object. This scalar is serialized like a String but isn't meant to be human-readable.

String
A UTF-8 character sequence.

Int
An integer value between -(231) and 232-1.

Float
An IEEE 754 floating point value.

Boolean
A Boolean value, either true or false.

AWS AppSync defines the following scalars:

AWSDate
An extended ISO 8601 date string in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

AWSTime
An extended ISO 8601 time string in the format hh:mm:ss.sss.

AWSDateTime
An extended ISO 8601 date and time string in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ.
```

Model directive automatically adds createdAt and updatedAt timestamps to each entities. 
The timestamp field names can be changed by passing timestamps attribute to the directive

```
type Post @model(timestamps:{createdAt: "createdOn", updatedAt: "updatedOn"}) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  tags: [String!]!
}
```

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    example: 
        Please view this next immediate section on a wide screen. "Index Name", "Partition Key", "Sort Key", 
        and "GraphQL Query Name" are labels for the syntax directly below them. 
```
type PostEditor
  @model        Index Name            Partition Key   Sort Key              GraphQL Query Name
  @key(name: "categoryIndex", fields: ["category",  "priority"], queryField: "todosByCategory"){
  id: ID!   
  name: String!
  description: String
  category: String
  priority: Int
  }
```
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

@connection
The @connection directive enables you to specify relationships between @model types. 
Currently, this supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships. 
You may implement many-to-many relationships using two one-to-many connections and a joining @model type. 
See the usage section for details.

https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/connection

    Note: After you have pushed a @connection directive you should not try to change it. If you try to change it, 
    the DynamoDB UpdateTable operation will fail. Should you need to change a @connection, you should add a new @connection 
    that implements the new access pattern, update your application to use the new @connection, and then delete the old @connection 
    when itâ€™s no longer needed.

Data access patterns
In the DynamoDB documentation for modeling relational data in a NoSQL database, there is an in depth example of 17 access patterns from the 
First Steps for Modeling Relational Data in DynamoDB page.
https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql-transformer/dataaccess

___________________________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________
Has One
Simplest:
```
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  team: Team @connection
}

type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```
____________________________________
Has One
You can also define the field you would like to use for the connection by populating the first argument to the fields array and matching it to a field on the type:
```
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  teamID: ID!
  team: Team @connection(fields: ["teamID"])
}

type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```
____________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________________________


Has Many
```
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type Comment @model
  @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "content"]) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  content: String!
}
```
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Belongs to
You can make a connection bi-directional by adding a many-to-one connection to types that already have a one-to-many connection. In this case you add a connection from Comment to Post since each comment belongs to a post:
```
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type Comment @model
  @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "content"]) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  content: String!
  post: Post @connection(fields: ["postID"])
}
```
___________________________________________________________________________________________


Many-to-many connections
You can implement many to many using two 1-M @connections, an @key, and a joining @model. For example:
```
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  editors: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

# Create a join model and disable queries as you don't need them
# and can query through Post.editors and User.posts
type PostEditor
  @model(queries: null)
  @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "editorID"])
  @key(name: "byEditor", fields: ["editorID", "postID"]) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  editorID: ID!
  post: Post! @connection(fields: ["postID"])
  editor: User! @connection(fields: ["editorID"])
}

type User @model {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  posts: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byEditor", fields: ["id"])
}
```
